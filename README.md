# Reduced AVC/H.264 And HEVC Bitstreams

This repository includes the modified reference software of AVC/H.264 and HEVC. For more information please have refer to our paper:



### To Run A Quick Test:

After compiling the code, you can run the encoder/decoder and it will report the number of bits allocated for each frame by running:

```
bash run_quick_test.sh <vid_name>
```

If the code compiled and runs successfully, the test run should give an output similar to what is shown below:

```
